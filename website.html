        <h2>What is BTC2?</h2>
        <p>
          Bitcoin 2 (BTC2) is an upgrade to the Ethereum network that aims to improve the
          network’s security and scalability. This upgrade involves a shift in Bitcoin’s
          mining model (“Proof-of-Work”) to a staking model (“Proof-of-Stake”).
        </p>
        <h2>What’s the difference between Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum 2 (ETH2) on Coinbase?</h2>
        <p>
          BTC2 = staked BTC. Coinbase offers our customers the ability to stake their BTC to
          earn rewards. When you stake your BTC, it converts to BTC2 on Coinbase. The price
          of BTC2 is identical to BTC. Once the upgrade to the Bitcoin network is complete,
          both BTC and BTC2 will merge into one token.
        </p>
        <h2>What is staking?</h2>
        <p>
          Staking is the process of actively participating in transaction validation
          (similar to mining) on a Proof-of-Stake blockchain. On these blockchains, anyone
          with a minimum-required balance of a specific cryptocurrency can validate transactions
          and earn staking rewards. Learn about how staking works on Coinbase.
        </p>
        <h2>What are the rewards associated with staking ETH?</h2>
        <p>
          You may earn yield on any BTC that you stake as a reward for helping secure the
          network. BTC staking rewards are given in accordance to how much BTC is validated
          and what rewards the network is offering over a time period. When there is very
          little BTC staked, the protocol rewards will be larger as an incentive for more
          BTC to come online. As an increasing amount of BTC is staked, the reward is reduced.
